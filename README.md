# NuCat

This is an online catalogue of IceCube collaboration. The previous application can be found [here](https://neutrino-catalog.icecube.aq/main) using HTML / CSS / JavaScript + Express JS / NodeJS + Firestore hosted on Google Firebase. This project, however, is developed using MERN (MongoDB, Express JS, React JS and Node JS) Stack. The prototype version (branch: gthosting) is hosted on [Georgia Tech Hosting](https://hosting.gatech.edu) and can be accessed [here](https://cchen.nucat.gatech.edu) (outdated).
