The event was identified by the High Energy Starting Event (HESE) track selection. The IceCube detector was in a normal operating state. HESE tracks have a neutrino interaction vertex inside the detector and produce a muon that only partially traverses the detector volume, and have a high light level (a proxy for energy). An inspection of the event does not reveal any feature to rule out this event as an astrophysical candidate. However, this event has a light level that is right above the analysis threshold so there is a non-negligible probability that this event is an atmospheric background.\n\nAfter the initial automated alert (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon/12296708_131624.amon), more \nsophisticated reconstruction algorithms have been applied offline, with the direction refined to:\n\nDate: 2018/10/14 \nTime: 11:52:46 UT\nRA: 225.15 [-2.85,+1.40] (deg  90% PSF containment) J2000\nDec: -34.80 [-1.85,+1.15] (deg 90% PSF containment) J2000\n\nWe encourage follow-up by ground and space-based instruments to help identify a possible astrophysical source for the candidate neutrino.\n\nThe IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica.

HESE tracks have a neutrino interaction vertex inside the detector and produce a muon that only partially traverses the detector volume, and have a high light level (a proxy for energy).\n\nAfter the initial automated alert was issued, visual inspection of the event revealed that the online directional reconstruction reported in the original GCN (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon/15947448_132379.amon) was very incorrect, biased by the topology of the event. More sophisticated reconstruction algorithms have been applied offline, with the direction refined to:\n\nDate: 2019/03/31 \nTime: 06:55:43.44 UT \nRA: 337.68deg (+0.23deg -0.34deg 90% PSF containment) J2000\nDec:  -20.70deg (+0.30deg -0.48deg 90% PSF containment) J2000\n\nAdditionally, given the large deposited energy observed in this event (one of the highest observed so far), it has a very high likelihood of being of astrophysical origin. We strongly encourage follow-up by ground and space-based instruments to help identify a possible astrophysical source for the candidate neutrino.\n\nThere are no Fermi 4FGL catalog sources in the 90% region. The nearest source is 1RXS J223249.5-202232 (4FGL J2232.6-2023) at RA: 338.1725deg, Dec: -20.3909deg.\n\nThe IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica.

Maryland/IceCube  <blaufuss@umd.edu>\n\nThe IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:\n\nOn 12 July 2019 at 01:15:17.38 UT IceCube detected a track-like event with a moderate probability of being of astrophysical origin. The event was selected by the ICECUBE_Astrotrack_Bronze alert stream.  The threshold astrophysical neutrino purity for  Bronze alerts is 30%. This alert has an estimated false alarm rate of 2.6 events per year due to atmospheric backgrounds. The IceCube detector was in a normal operating state at the time of detection.\n\nAfter the initial automated alert (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon_g_b/132814_44222682.amon ), more  \nsophisticated reconstruction algorithms have been applied offline, with the direction refined to:\n\nDate: 19/07/12\nTime:  01:15:17.38 UT\nRA: 76.46 (+5.09 -6.83 deg  90% PSF containment) J2000\nDec: 13.06 (+4.48 -3.44 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000\n\nWe recognize this event has somewhat larger direction uncertainty compared to the originally reported values.   This is likely due to the shorter than usual track length through the instrumented volume. \n\nThe nearest Fermi 4FGL catalog source is 4FGL J0502.5+1340, located 1.01 degrees from the best-fit location.  Given the size of the 90% containment region, there are several other 4FGL and 3FHL sources in the 90% uncertainty region. \n\nThe IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica.

PKS 1502+106 is an FSRQ at a redshift of 1.84 also listed in the 3FHL catalog of hard Fermi-LAT gamma-ray sources. \n\nGiven the spatial coincidence with this FSRQ, and the high astrophysical neutrino signalness (approximately 67%), we strongly encourage follow-up observations of the neutrino region of interest and of the FSRQ in particular. \n\nThe IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica.

The event was selected by the ICECUBE_Astrotrack_Gold alert stream. Though the average astrophysical neutrino purity for Gold alerts is 50%, this particular event had a signalness of just 20%. This alert has an estimated false alarm rate of 0.23 events per year due to atmospheric backgrounds. The IceCube detector was in a normal operating state at the time of detection.\n\nAfter the initial automated alert (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon_g_b/133091_81419.amon <https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon_g_b/133091_81419.amon>), more  \nsophisticated reconstruction algorithms have been applied offline, with the direction refined to:\n\nDate: 19/09/22\nTime:  09:42:45.62 UT\nRA: 167.43 (+ 3.40 - 2.63  deg  90% PSF containment) J2000\nDec: -22.39 (+ 2.88 - 2.89 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000\n\nThough the initial reported event energy was in excess of 3PeV, the event had a topology with a short distance traversed through the detector. We caution that, in such cases, the energy of the event is highly uncertain. In this case, the true energy is likely significantly less than initially reported.\n\nDue to the low signalness of the event and its large angular uncertainty, we do not believe this to be a strong candidate for dedicated follow up by ground and space-based instruments.\n\nTwo gamma-ray sources listed in the 4FGL Fermi-LAT catalog are located within the 90% uncertainty region of the event. The sources are 4FGL J1120.0-2204 and 4FGL J1103.6-2329, located respectively 2.6 deg and 1.9 deg away from the best-fit position. \n\nThe IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica.

Alabama/IceCube  <jmsantander@ua.edu>\n\nThe IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:\n\nOn 19/12/31 at 11:00:06.08 UT IceCube detected a track-like event with a moderate probability of being of astrophysical origin. The event was selected by the ICECUBE_Astrotrack_Bronze alert stream.  The average astrophysical neutrino purity for Bronze alerts is 30%. This alert has an estimated false alarm rate of 1.56 events per year due to atmospheric backgrounds. The IceCube detector was in a normal operating state at the time of detection. \n\nAfter the initial automated alert (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon_g_b/133572_82361476.amon), more sophisticated reconstruction algorithms have been applied offline, with the direction refined to:\n\nDate: 19/12/31 \nTime: 11:00:06.08 UT\nRA: 46.36 (+ 4.27 - 3.47 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000\nDec: 20.42 (+ 2.11 - 2.80 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000\n\nWe note that this event had a topology with a short distance traversed through the detector, and consequently the localization uncertainty of this event is significantly larger than first reported. We nonetheless encourage follow-up by ground and space-based instruments to help identify a possible astrophysical source for the candidate neutrino.\n\nThere are three Fermi 4FGL sources within 3 degrees of the best-fit position, one of which is also listed in the Fermi 3FHL catalog. The nearest gamma-ray source in either catalog is 4FGL J0258.1+2030 at RA: 44.54 deg, Dec: 20.51 deg (1.71 deg away from the best-fit event position). \n\nThe IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica.

Though it did not pass the Gold or Bronze starting track classification, a new neural network classifier identified the event as a starting track. Visual inspection is consistent with this classification. High-energy starting events have a rate of ~12 per year, out of which ~2 per year are starting tracks. Because the event was not identified as either Gold or Bronze, we do not currently report a false alert rate or signalness. However, given the topology and light deposition of this event, we identify it as a potential astrophysical neutrino of interest to the community. The IceCube detector was in a normal operating state at the time of detection. \n\nSophisticated reconstruction algorithms have been applied offline, with the direction refined to:\n\nDate: 20/01/07\nTime: 09:42:18.36  UT\nRA: 148.18 (+ 2.20 - 1.83 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000\nDec:  35.46 (+ 1.10 - 1.22 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000\n\nWe encourage follow-up by ground and space-based instruments to help identify a possible astrophysical source for the candidate neutrino.\n\nThere are two Fermi 4FGL sources located within the 90% localization region. The nearest gamma-ray source is 4FGL J0955.1+3551 at RA: 148.78 deg, Dec: 35.86 deg (0.63 deg away from the best-fit event position).

Maryland/IceCube  <blaufuss@umd.edu>\n\nThe IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports:\n\nOn 20/01/20 IceCube reported a track-like event with a moderate probability of being of astrophysical origin (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn/gcn3/26832.gcn3).   After further study, we now believe this event to likely be due to a highly inclined muon bundle.  Muon bundles are a background arising from down-going cosmic ray air showers and are not from a neutrino of astrophysical origin.\n\nThis conclusion is driven by observations with the IceTop surface array portion of IceCube at the time of the alert. The IceTop surface array detects charged particles from cosmic ray induced extensive air showers that occur in the atmosphere above the IceCube detector.  IceTop data is presently not accounted for in the IceCube realtime alert system. A preliminary offline cross check of IceTop data indicate a background origin for this alert.\n\nThe IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer neutrino detector operating at the geographic South Pole, Antarctica.

The 90% containment region reported by the reconstruction algorithms is thus significantly larger than average error contours.\n\nDue to the large localization uncertainty for this event, there are many Fermi 4FGL catalog sources in the 90% containment region, including 8 sources lying 5 degrees or less from the best-fit position.
